Features
========

- Pipeline integration mode
- p-value whether two samples are paired
- input file which lists pairings?
- Bind everything into one binary
- possibility to add files to existing analysis


Correctness
===========

- test combinations of RNA-seq, DNA-seq, Exome-Seq
- test samples for depth to make sure they're sufficient for variant calling?
  => maybe better to just document this?
- threshold for calling two samples paired?
